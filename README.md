# Project 2: Optical Illusions

The creation and discussion around optical illusions is generally agreed to date back to ancient Greece, where they were utilized in architecture and art. Since then, our understanding and science of what makes them work has continued to evolve. These days, it is easy to view whole archives of optical illusions, catalogized into such groupings as physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions. In this project your goal will be to recreate several of these illusions using the PGL library. Along the way, you will be tasked with writing and using functions to accomplish your artistic ends.

The full guide to this project can be found on the class website.
